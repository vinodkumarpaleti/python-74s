- [Python v3.11 Download](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.7/python-3.11.7-amd64.exe)
- The extension of a python script is **.py**
- In any programming or scripting language, we have 4 important blocks to understand:
  1. Variables
  2. Conditions
  3. Loops
  4. Functions

## Datatypes

- Integer: E.g. 1, 2, 3, 4 etc
- Float: E.g. 1.2, 2.0, 3.5 etc
- Boolean: True or False
- String: 'a', "This is a string", "Today's weather is nice"
- List
- Tuple
- Set
- Dict

## Arithematic operations

- `+`: Addition
- `-`: Subtraction
- `*`: Multiplication
- `/`: Division
- `//`: Floor Division
- `%`: Modulo operator
- `**`: Power

## Variable naming rules

1. Names can not start with a number. E.g. 1abc
2. There can be no spaces in the name, use `_` instead. E.g. abc def (Not Valid), abc_def (Valid)
3. Can't use any of these symbols :'",<>/?|\()!@#$%^&*~-+ except `_` For e.g `_abc`
4. It's considered best practice (PEP8) that names are lowercase.
5. Avoid using the characters 'l', 'O', or 'I' as single character variable names.
6. Avoid using words that have special meaning in Python like "list" and "str" as they are [reserved keywords](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords)
