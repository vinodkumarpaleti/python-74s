# Session 70

## Topics covered

- Tuple datatype
  - Constructing Tuple
  - Methods
  - Properties
- Dictionary datatype
- Sets datatype

### Constructing Tuple

- A tuple in python can be defined using: `()` for e.g. `(1, 2, 3)`
- Tuple is an immutable datatype. Therefore it doesn't support append and extend operations

### Methods in Tuple

- `index()`
- `count()`

## Dictionaries

- A dictonary is created using `{'key': 'value'}` pair structure
- Keys should always be of immutable datatype such as tuple, strings, numbers etc
- In dictonaries, the order in which the elements are inserted is retained
- Nested dict:

  ```python
  sample_dict = {
    "employee": {
        "name": "John",
        "age": 30,
        "city": "New York"
    }
  }
  ```

### Methods in dict

- `keys()`
- `values()`
- `items()`

## Sets datatype

- Set doesn't allow duplicates in the dataset
- The order of insertion in set is not retained
- To add elements to a set, we use `add()` method

### Typecasting

- Changing the datatype of a variable i.e. list -> tuple or list -> set etc

## Booleans

- True and False are only the two possible values that can be for booleans

## Comparisions

- `==` -> compares whether two values are equal or not and returns true if equal and false if not
- `!=` -> not equal to i.e. compares whether two values are equal or not
- `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`

### Chained comparisions

- `and` -> If both the conditions are True only then the result will be true
- `or` -> If one of the condition is True, the result will be True
- `not`
- E.g. `1 < 2 < 3` -> `(1 < 2) and (2 < 3)` Therefore the result is True

## Conditons

- If-else statement
- If-elif-else statement
